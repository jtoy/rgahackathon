# goal:

we are going to try and modify a neural network to generate different effects.  then we make a bot that takes requests from a service we choose (slack, reddit,twitter) and generate photo callergy.  

 images will be generated using neural style and deep dream.

be able to test out different visualizations of deep dream and 


Training on these algorithms usually takes a day to several weeks depending on the training data and the parameters chosen for the models.

So we will provide pretrained models for you to use.

Now you can  view any of pretrained deep dream and style transfers we have:



We have provided some sample code that runs to generate images given a folder. to run it you should have bash and curl installed.


generate_gallery.sh /path/to/folder

This should be enough for you to



# Why Deep Learning Image Transformation Matters For Advertisers, Marketers, and Designers
### Machine learning will become a stardard part of the creator toolkit. 
###It's not equivalent to a human expert, but it's fast and scalable.

## What deep learning will enable you to do.

##### Build Better Products

*People love personalization of products and featuring themselves or friends. ??? examples ???*

One of a kind products give customers a way to stand out and express themselves. We see these features in products like NIKEiD. But, even in this case the option set is limited. With deep learning to personalization is endless. Perhaps you really, really, really, love your cat.

Content that features the customer is a big part of consumer facing custom printing. Printing photos of your friends and family, buttons for your high school election, or posters for your band are just a few cases where you might want to apply some sort of deep learning filter. Somatic is currently being utilized on one site that provides easy custom printing and framing.

##### Create Engaging Ads 

*It's really hard to stand out in the digital space. And, even if you catch someone's eye, how can you get them to think about your brand and shere their interest with friends. *

Snapchat has created a variety of fun and engaging ads. Similar branded and personalized video content is being created cross platform by companies like Vivoom. Machine learning models are used in many of these applications today, and going forward will likely expand what is possible.

As another example, we have made a simple filter that could be branded for any coffee shop on Somatic. It's early, you are watching the sunrise but you have not had your coffee yet and this is all you can think about. A styled image is a much more fun way to share that condition than text.

##### Accelerate Content Creation

*Custom models can accelerate the creation process by allowing new images styled with little work, and making it easy to control the style shown via web languages.*

For example, espnfc.us often uses artistic images to tell stories. While no fast neural style model can match human created content, for prototyping or applications where a desiger isn't justified, neural style can provide a new possibility. Additionally, the API will make it easy to switch styles on the fly.

# KEEP WORKING FROM HERE

##### Capatalize on Cutting Edge Image

The cutting edge can be engaging and fun, should keep it in the tool kit for the right time. Brands with a digital footprint, a young demo, and a focus on tech may be able to create viral products by relying on the cool/fun factor.
