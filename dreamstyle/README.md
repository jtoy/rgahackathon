goal:

we are going to try and modify a neural network to generate different effects.  then we make a bot that takes requests from a service we choose (slack, reddit,twitter) and generate photo callergy.  

 images will be generated using neural style and deep dream.

be able to test out different visualizations of deep dream and 


Training on these algorithms usually takes a day to several weeks depending on the training data and the parameters chosen for the models.

So we will provide pretrained models for you to use.

Now you can  view any of pretrained deep dream and style transfers we have:



We have provided some sample code that runs to generate images given a folder. to run it you should have bash and curl installed.


generate_gallery.sh /path/to/folder

This should be enough for you to
