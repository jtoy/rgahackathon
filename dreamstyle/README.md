# goal:

we are going to try and modify a neural network to generate different effects.  then we make a bot that takes requests from a service we choose (slack, reddit,twitter) and generate photo callergy.  

 images will be generated using neural style and deep dream.

be able to test out different visualizations of deep dream and 


Training on these algorithms usually takes a day to several weeks depending on the training data and the parameters chosen for the models.

So we will provide pretrained models for you to use.

Now you can  view any of pretrained deep dream and style transfers we have:



We have provided some sample code that runs to generate images given a folder. to run it you should have bash and curl installed.


generate_gallery.sh /path/to/folder

This should be enough for you to



# Why Deep Learning Image Transformation Matters For Advertisers, Marketers, and Designers
### Machine learning will become a stardard part of the creator toolkit. 
###It's not equivalent to a human expert, but it's fast and scalable.

##### Build Better Products

People love personalization of products ??? examples ???

* Custom printing, cards

* NikeID v.future

* On current implementation

##### Create Engaging Ads 

User generated content is engaging. Branded filters are a way to drive sharing.

* Key part of snapchats approach

* Coffee brand -- it's early, watching sunrise but all i can see is coffee for me. The demo below is with neural style, but could also take an inceptionism approach.

##### Accelerate Content Creation

Custom designs can accelerate the creation process

* For example, espnfc.us often users artistic images to tell stories. Neural style can be built to automate this

* Can also be used for ad storytelling, take our I have not had my morning coffee filter



##### Capatalize on Cutting Edge Image

The cutting edge can be engaging and fun, should keep it in the tool kit for the right time. Brands with a digital footprint, a young demo, and a focus on tech may be able to create viral products by relying on the cool/fun factor.
